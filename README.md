Book API

This is my first API built using Express Node.js

Details

This is the basic structure of an API that allows you to perform the basic functions of a library.
It was built during my internship program at genesystechhub.

Brief

You can create a new library, create new books, add book, delete book, get book using the book's id, get book by searching for any of the parameter value, borrow book, return book, and see borrowed books READ THE DOCUMENTATION TEXT FILE FOR MORE DETAILS ON HOW TO USE.

Hosting

You can run this on your local server using the port 3000 or you can change the port by modifying line 9 0f the bookAPI.js

Testing

I tested this API using Google's Advanced Rest Client
